// Package mpi implements an mpi-like interface for go. This package seeks to
// enable distributed-memory parallel computation using only native go code.
// While this package seeks to present a familiar interface to users of MPI,
// it does not follow the MPI standard exactly. In cases where package
// documentation disagrees with the MPI standard, the package documentation
// should be considered correct.
//
// The Message Passing Interface, MPI [1], is a communications protocol for
// distributed memory systems. In MPI, a single program is executed in parallel
// on different machines. The MPI routines are used in order to communicate
// data between them. MPI emphasises speed over robustness, and should only be
// used in highly reliable systems, such as a computation cluster. From the
// standard: "An MPI implementation cannot or may choose not to handle some
// errors that occur during MPI calls".
//
// This package provides a set of MPI functions and defines the Mpi interface.
// Programs should use the function calls directly to allow portibility
// of programs. Generally, a specific implementation of mpi.Mpi should be
// regestered during an init() function of package main. Many of the functions
// allow errors to be returned, but it is up to the implementation to actually
// use the errors. Implementations may panic when errors occur.
//
// This package also provides mpi.Network, an implementation of the mpi.Mpi
// the interface built upon the net package in the standard library.
//
// A MPI program must begin with a call to Init() and should end with a call
// to Finalize(). Init determines the size, or number of nodes, size, to be used
// during the computation, and assigns each node a unique integer identifier,
// "rank", which has a value 0 <= rank < size. Init establishes connections
// among the nodes to allow point-to-point communication.
//
// During program exectution, processes may communicate with one another
// using the Send and Receive calls. MPI only specifies the behavior of routines,
// not their implementation
//
// Package MPI also adds several flags to aid in simplicity.
//		-mpi-addr : address of the local running process
//		-mpi-alladdr: comma separated list of the strings of all the addresses
//		-mpi-initimeout: time.Duration for how long init can take before timing out.
//		-mpi-protocol: string to represent the protocol to use
//		-mpi-password: password to use at MPI initialization
// Specific implementations are free to use or ignore these as desired
// flag.Parse() must be called in order to use these flags.
//
// By default, the Network protocol is used. See type documentation for behavior.
//
// All function calls are blocking. Use go's native concurrency (goroutines,
// channels, and package sync) to achive non-blocking behavior.
